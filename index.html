<h4>Pre-School</h4>

<p>Children are enrolled into different programmes according to their age 
    : Pre - Nursery, Nursery, Kindergarten 1, Kindergarten 2

    The thematic 
    curriculum for preschool draws on neuroscientific research on how the
    brain learns naturally and what learning experiences are relevant at a
     particular age and stage in life.</p>

<h4></h4>Primary-School</h4>

<p>The Curriculum for grades 1-4 is thoughtfully planned to ensure that each child<br>
    at school enjoys these years in learning, discovery and creative engagement.<br>
    Research on how the brain learns best, developmental appropriateness, the theory <br>of Multiple Intelligences and the National Curricular Framework, 2005 have guided the planned curriculum.</p>

<h4>Middle-School</h4>

<p>At Open Minds, we emphasize on providing an inspiring school environment which <br>
    enables a shift from rote methods to a course beyond textbooks.The curriculum aims<br>
     to provide experiences and opportunities for students to think differently, analyze and<br>
      evaluate independently and foster a place where we can soften subject boundaries...</p>

<h4>High-School</h4>

<p>The Primary and Middle school approach of using experiential and student centric <br>
    methodologies continues in the Open Minds High School years. The transition is <br>
    smooth and allows the students to prepare for the school leaving certificate examinations.<br>
    At the High School stage the Open Minds Schools offer a variety of options to the students.</p>
